Implementation of ReactJS with Rails tutorial from here: https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers

This version uses ES6 instead of CoffeeScript. You can use ES6 with react-rails by adding the extra command --es6 to the component generation command:

```
rails generate react:component ComponentName --es6
```
